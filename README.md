## Project Overview

This research investigates how the mouse olfactory system processes sensory information, focusing on:

- Comprehensive mapping of odorant receptor (OR) expression in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and olfactory bulb (OB)
- Analysis of sensory neuron distribution patterns
- Identification of spatial domains for olfactory responses
- Molecular basis of sensory processing in the olfactory system

## Installation
